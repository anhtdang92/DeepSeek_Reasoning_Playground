2025-02-15 23:08:33 - Response: **

**Step 1:** Calculate the total distance traveled by the train.

**Step 2:** Calculate the total time taken for the journey.

**Step 3:** Use the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time.

**Step 4:** Plug the numbers into the formula and compute the average speed.

**Step 5:** Round the result to the appropriate number of decimal places or as a whole number if possible.

**Step 6:** Present the final answer clearly.
Alright, so I need to figure out the average speed of a train that travels two different segments. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, average speed isn't just the average of the two speeds; it's the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. That makes sense because if the train spends different amounts of time on each segment, the average will reflect that.

Okay, so let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1:** Calculate the total distance traveled by the train.

The problem says the train goes 300 miles in the first part and then 400 miles in the second part. So, I just need to add these two distances together.

300 miles + 400 miles = 700 miles.

That seems straightforward.

**Step 2:** Calculate the total time taken for the journey.

The first part takes 5 hours, and the second part takes 8 hours. So, adding those together:

5 hours + 8 hours = 13 hours.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 5 plus 8 is definitely 13. Okay, that's correct.

**Step 3:** Use the formula for average speed.

Average speed = total distance / total time.

So, plugging in the numbers I have:

Average speed = 700 miles / 13 hours.

Hmm, let me compute that. 700 divided by 13. I think I can do this division.

13 goes into 70 five times because 13*5 is 65. Subtract 65 from 70, you get 5. Bring down the next

Okay, so I need to figure out the average speed for the entire train journey. Hmm, let me think about how average speed works. I remember that average speed isn't just the average of the two speeds; instead, it's the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Yeah, that makes sense because speed can vary during different parts of the trip, so just averaging the two speeds would give an incorrect result.

Alright, so the train makes two parts to its journey. The first part is 300 miles in 5 hours, and the second part is 400 miles in 8 hours. I need to calculate the total distance and the total time and then divide them.

Let me write down the given information:

First leg:
- Distance: 300 miles
- Time: 5 hours

Second leg:
- Distance: 400 miles
- Time: 8 hours

So, total distance would be the sum of these two distances. Let me add them up: 300 + 400. Hmm, 300 plus 400 is 700 miles. That seems straightforward.

Now, for the total time. The first leg took 5 hours and the second took 8 hours. Adding those together: 5 + 8. That gives 13 hours in total. Okay, so the train traveled a total distance of 700 miles over 13 hours.

To find the average speed, I'll use the formula:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

Plugging in the numbers I just found:

Average speed = 700 miles / 13 hours

Now, let me calculate that. 700 divided by 13. Hmm, 13 times 50 is 650, because 13*50=650. Then 700 - 650 is 50. So that's 50 miles left after 50 hours. But wait, 50 divided by 13 is approximately 3.846. So adding that to the 50, we

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a train traveling two different distances at two different speeds, and I need to find the average speed for the entire journey. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. So, I need to figure out the total distance the train has gone and the total time it took. Then, I can divide one by the other to get the average speed.

Alright, let's break it down. The problem says the train travels 300 miles in 5 hours. That seems straightforward. So, the first part of the journey is 300 miles, and it took 5 hours. Then, the second part is 400 miles in 8 hours. So, I need to add both distances together and both times together.

Let me write that down:

Total distance = 300 miles + 400 miles

Total time = 5 hours + 8 hours

Calculating the total distance: 300 plus 400 is 700 miles. That makes sense because 300 plus 400 is 700.

Now, for the total time: 5 hours plus 8 hours is 13 hours. Hmm, 5 plus 8 is definitely 13. Okay, so the train took 13 hours in total to cover the entire distance.

Now, average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, that would be 700 miles divided by 13 hours.

Let me calculate that. 700 divided by 13. Hmm, 13 times 50 is 650, right? Because 10 times 13 is 130, so 50 times 13 is 650. Then, 700 minus 650 is 50. So, 50 divided by 13 is approximately 3.846. So, adding that to the 50, we get approximately 53.84

**Solution:** 

First, I need to calculate the total distance traveled by the train. It went 300 miles and then 400 miles, so the total distance is 300 + 400 = 700 miles.

Next, I'll determine the total time taken for the journey. The train took 5 hours for the first part and 8 hours for the second part, so the total time is 5 + 8 = 13 hours.

Finally, to find the average speed, I'll divide the total distance by the total time. That gives me 700 miles divided by 13 hours, which equals approximately 53.85 miles per hour. Rounded to two decimal places, the average speed is 53.85 mph.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Total Distance:**
   - First part: 300 miles
   - Second part: 400 miles
   - **Total Distance = 300 + 400 = 700 miles**

2. **Calculate Total Time:**
   - First part: 5 hours
   - Second part: 8 hours
   - **Total Time = 5 + 8 = 13 hours**

3. **Calculate Average Speed:**
   - **Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time**
   - **Average Speed = 700 miles / 13 hours \u2248 53.85 mph**

**Final Answer:**  
The train's average speed for the entire journey is \boxed{53.85 \text{ mph}}.

3. **Compute the Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.
   - **Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 700 miles / 13 hours \u2248 53.85 mph**

4. **Round the Result:**
   - Rounding 53.85 mph to one decimal place gives us 53.9 mph.

**Final Answer:**

The average speed of the train for the entire journey is **53.9 mph**.
