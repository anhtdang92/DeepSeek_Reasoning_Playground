2025-02-15 22:57:43 - Response:  

**Answer:** The average speed is \boxed{24} miles per hour.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Identify the total distance traveled:**
   - The train travels 300 miles in the first part and 400 miles in the second part.
   - Total distance = 300 miles + 400 miles = 700 miles.

2. **Determine the total time taken:**
   - The train takes 5 hours for the first part and 8 hours for the second part.
   - Total time = 5 hours + 8 hours = 13 hours.

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average speed is the

2025-02-15 23:08:33 - Response: **

**Step 1:** Calculate the total distance traveled by the train.

**Step 2:** Calculate the total time taken for the journey.

**Step 3:** Use the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time.

**Step 4:** Plug the numbers into the formula and compute the average speed.

**Step 5:** Round the result to the appropriate number of decimal places or as a whole number if possible.

**Step 6:** Present the final answer clearly.
Alright, so I need to figure out the average speed of a train that travels two different segments. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, average speed isn't just the average of the two speeds; it's the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. That makes sense because if the train spends different amounts of time on each segment, the average will reflect that.

Okay, so let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1:** Calculate the total distance traveled by the train.

The problem says the train goes 300 miles in the first part and then 400 miles in the second part. So, I just need to add these two distances together.

300 miles + 400 miles = 700 miles.

That seems straightforward.

**Step 2:** Calculate the total time taken for the journey.

The first part takes 5 hours, and the second part takes 8 hours. So, adding those together:

5 hours + 8 hours = 13 hours.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 5 plus 8 is definitely 13. Okay, that's correct.

**Step 3:** Use the formula for average speed.

Average speed = total distance / total time.

So, plugging in the numbers I have:

Average speed = 700 miles / 13 hours.

Hmm, let me compute that. 700 divided by 13. I think I can do this division.

13 goes into 70 five times because 13*5 is 65. Subtract 65 from 70, you get 5. Bring down the next
